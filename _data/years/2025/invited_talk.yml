  bio: |-
    Samuel Thibault is Professor at the University of Bordeaux, and part of
    the Inria STORM team. His research revolves around task and data transfer
    scheduling in parallel and distributed runtime systems. He is currently focused
    on the design of the StarPU runtime, and more particularly its scheduling
    heuristics for heterogeneous architectures and for distributed systems.

  title: "Recursive tasks for fun and profit" 
  abstract: |-
    Recursive tasks have been proposed in various task-based runtime systems. While
    the details vary, a lot of commonalities arise, and similar performance benefits
    are observed by different research teams. On the application side, expressing
    computation recursively is also a pattern that arises commonly for expressing
    e.g algorithms on compressed data such as H-matrices. We will thus consider the
    current proposals and results, and discuss the kinds of benefits that we can
    expect in the long run. This can include making it easier to express complex
    algorithms with complex data structures, but also improve the efficiency of the
    execution in various ways, by using different granularities to drive the
    available parallelism and balance tasks granularities between heterogeneous
    resources, as well as parallelizing the tasks submissions and decoupling
    tasks from communication.
